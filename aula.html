    <h3>Born to Die</h3>
    <h6>Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
        Sometimes love is not enough
        And the road gets tough, I don't know why
        Keep making me laugh
        Let's go get high
        The road is long, we carry on
        Try to have fun in the meantime
        Come and take a walk on the wild side
        Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
        You like your girls insane, so (louder)
        Choose your last words, this is the last time
        'Cause you and I, we were born to die</h6>
